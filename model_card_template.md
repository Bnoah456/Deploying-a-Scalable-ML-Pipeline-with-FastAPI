Model Details
This model is a Random Forest Classifier trained on the Census Bureau dataset. The model predicts whether an individual earns more than $50K a year based on demographic and employment data.

Intended Use
The model is intended to support analyses of demographic and employment data for educational purposes. It can be used for insights into socioeconomic factors affecting income levels.

Training Data
The model was trained using the Census Bureau dataset containing 32,561 samples and 14 features, including age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, and native country.

Evaluation Data
The evaluation data consists of a 20% split of the original dataset, amounting to 6,512 samples. This test set ensures the model's performance is evaluated on unseen data.

Metrics
Precision: 0.7419 | Recall: 0.6384 | F1: 0.6863

The modelâ€™s performance was measured using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's accuracy, relevance, and robustness.

Ethical Considerations
While the model offers valuable insights, it is essential to consider ethical implications, such as potential biases in the dataset that could affect the model's predictions. Ensuring fairness and accuracy across different demographic groups is crucial.

Caveats and Recommendations
The model's performance may vary with different datasets or in real-world applications. Regular updates and retraining with new data are recommended to maintain accuracy. Users should be mindful of the limitations and ethical considerations when deploying this model.
